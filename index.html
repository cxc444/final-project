							<h2>U-Boats</h2>
							<p>The German "Unterseeboot", or U-Boat, were submarines designed to float near the surface and were armed with mines, deck guns, and torpedoes. They played a large role in WWI and WWII
								engaging in acts of ship hunting and strategic attacks of enemy shipping lines.</p>

										<h2>Ship Hunting</h2>
										<p>The German use of U-Boats to target shipping routes largely changed the course of the war.</p>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>By the beginning of WWI, Germany had produced 38 U Boats. Midway through, they had created over 300. The decision to engage in unrestricted warfare against merchant ships
										came in February 1917. In the month of April 1917, German U Boats sunk a total of 852,000 tons of Allied and Neutral ships.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>This was one of the main reasons the US entered the war. In response, allied forces used armed convoys to protect merchant ships who either delivered
										 supplies to allies or were neutral to the war. This proved effective against the German's tactics, aided by the US Destroyer fleets to combat U-Boat attacks.

							<h2>Black Sunday</h2>
							<p>One of the most devastating U-Boat attacks near US territory.</p>
						</header>
						<p>On June 2, 1918, the Germans attacked American cargo ships for the first time. On this day, the U-151 sunk six ships and damaged over two. Included were the liner <i>SS Carolina</i>, freighters <i>Winnecone</i> and <i>Texel</i>,
						 and the schooner <i>Isabel B. Wiley</i>. Before attacking, the U-151 fired off warning shots to let passengers abandon their ships. In all, the crew and passengers totalled 448 people, and 13 died due to one of the <i>SS Carolina</i>'s lifeboats capsizing.</p>

							<h2>Advancements of WWII</h2>
							<p>New U-Boats were constructed in-between wartime periods.</p>
						</header>
						<p>Though Allied forces triumphed and ultimately overcame the shipping attacks of WWI, and despite the restrictions imposed on Germany during the Treat of Versailles, Germany continued to make advancements of their sub technologies.
							 The invention of the "schnorkel", a simple device that used a tube to provide U-Boats with enough oxygen for their diesel engines to operate for longer periods while submerged, made it much more difficult for allied forces to detect German subs. U-Boats often stayed concealed underwater until nighttime when it was safer to surface and use the schnorkel.
